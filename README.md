This is a personal portfolio stock management app

It uses google drive api to sync your data across devices, so it needs a google account

It uses [Alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for querying stock values, so you have to provide an Alphavantage API key. They offer a free API key with limited capabilities that are fine for a small portfolio.

Check it out on https://stockbook.now.sh

It only suppors EUR and USD currencies and lacks a lot of features and probably some features are useless, but it is a work in progress!
